    <h1 id = "what is">HTML History</h1>
        <p>Berners-Lee's idea arose around 1989, and for the next two years he defined HTML as a subset of SGML, which he later called Level 0.In that first version, only the title, letters and anchor characters were selected, but that was enough to create a web page. Various versions of this initial HTML have appeared, but none have become an official standard. The closest is HTML 2.0, which has been given a name to distinguish it from the emerging set of informal standards. Tim Berners founded the W3C (World Wide Web Consotium) in 1995, and soon after the third version, HTML 3.0, came out. This has given more creative freedom to web designers.This makes it easy to create tables, text can wrap around images, and complex mathematical elements are displayed. Its creators wanted it to be compatible with the previous version, but the browsers of the time could not support it.In September of this year, the project was abandoned due to lack of support from web browser manufacturers. The next version is also not officially offered.The new version of HTML 3.2 removed many elements introduced in HTML 3.0 in exchange for elements developed by web browser manufacturers such as Netscape and Mosaic. For example, the ability to import complex mathematical formulas to be delegated to another standard, MathML, has been removed. The latest version, HTML 4.0, also contains many specific elements designed for this web browser, but marks many of them as 'deprecated'. The evolution of HTML is very complicated, having to process many parts before it stops. But the technology is still evolving and now its successor is XHTML. The basis and purpose are the same, but this time a new element appears: XML in the context. Another standard that is functionally similar to SGML, but simpler and younger. So, from the 'fusion' of these two standards, XML and HTML, XHTML was born.</p>

    <h1 id = "html 2">HTML 2.0</h1>
        <p>In 1995, HTML 2.0 was released. Despite its name, HTML 2.0 was the first official HTML standard, which means that HTML 1.0 does not exist as a standard. HTML 2.0 does not support tables. The document structure has been simplified as much as possible to speed up editing, where explicit declaration of body, html and header elements is optional.</p>

    <h1 id = "html 3">HTML 3.2</h1>
        <p>Was published in 1997 and was the first HTML recommendation published by the W3C (International Consortium). This version includes the latest enhancements to web pages developed before 1996, such as Java applications and wrapping text around images.<p/>
